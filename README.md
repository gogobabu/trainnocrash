# trainnocrash
I am trying to explore the reason and possible solutions from the recent train crashed seen in India in 2024.  I do not understand why such an old technology (trains and tracks) are facing such issues. Is it a Human Problem? Or there are issues with the tracks? Or the mapping is flawed.
